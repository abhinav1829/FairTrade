## Lender-Borrower interaction with Credit Risk Analysis
At FairTrade, we offer a platform where visitors have the opportunity to register as either lenders or borrowers. To ensure trust and security, FairTrade conducts a thorough verification process for all registered borrowers. This process evaluates a wide range of information, including personal, financial, and professional details, to generate a Repayment Score. This score is a reflection of a borrower's creditworthiness and repayment capacity, providing lenders with a reliable metric to assess potential risks before extending a loan. Consequently, lenders can easily identify and engage with borrowers who meet their criteria for credit reliability, facilitating a smooth and secure lending process.
